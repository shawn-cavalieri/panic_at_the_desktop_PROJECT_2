        <h4> <mark>Summary:</mark> </h4>
         <ul>
           <li>The Dot Com Bubble burst (a.k.a. tech bubble, internet bubble) was a recession in the early 2000s that was 
          largely started by speculation on tech companies. Computer and Internet use exploded in the early 1990s and investors were hungry to get in on the action, 
          regardless of how companies were valued, their profitability, or their P/E ratios. This led to internet and tech stocks being heavily overvalued until the "bubble" 
          burst in March of 2000. The Nasdaq Index lost 78% of it's value from it's peak and many other internet companies went out of business altogether. </li>

        <h4> <mark>Amazon:</mark> </h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Amazon went public in May of 1997, right in the midst of the bubble, and saw absolutely enormous growth in value almost immediately</li>
            <li>Within 2 years, Amazon had expanded it's offerings from only books to many other products as well, and the stock grew by nearly 5000% </li>
            <li>By late 2001, Amazon had lost over 90% of it's value from it's peak, but due to savy reinvesting and a large number of new offerings, including original 
              products (Echo, Kindle, Prime, etc..), the company was able to remain aflout and is one of the largest, most valuable companies in the world today

      <h4> <mark>Main Events:</mark> </h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Y2K (Year 2000 Problem) led to fear that computer systems would not be able to adjust to the calendar systems. This created additional uncertainty for internet stocks
            in general
          </li>
          <li>Feb 2000 - Fed raised interest rates aggresively, many analysts had doubts about tech companies being able to afford higher borrowing costs</li>
          <li>March 2020 - Japan entered a recession, largely affected tech stocks in the US</li>
          <li>March 2020 - Article in Barron's Magazine comes out suggesting internet companies are running out of money. Interest rates were raised the next day and the 
            yeild curve inverted </li>
          <li>April 2020 - Lawsuit against Microsoft finds them guilty of Monopolization, 8% drop in Nasdaq and 25% drop over the past two weeks</li>
          <li>2001 - Further bankrupticies, accounting scandals (Enron, Worldcom, etc..) and September 11th attacks send the market further down, hitting a trough in October
            of 2002 and losing 78% of its value from its peak in March 2000

      <h4> <mark>Cisco:</mark> </h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Cisco went public in 1990 and quickly became an industry and tech giant in the early 1990s </li>
          <li>They supplied many large enterprises with their hardware and were able to support the internet bandwith requirements of major companies 
            that other providers could not match </li>
